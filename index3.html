  <h1> Front Ensemble(Pit) #3 </h1>
  <h3> Winter Drumline and Marching Band</h3>
  </body>
<p> A typical life in pit requires more hard work and more practice. Pit people usually go up to the field first when they practice because it takes them a long time to push heavy equipments and it takes a long time to set up. Like any other section, Pit has more responsibilites for the care of their instruments. Pit instruments such as mallets instruments are delicate. Pit is a really fun section. Pit players like to goof around sometimes but they get to work and practice what they need to pratice.</p>
<p> Hello, my name is Maxene and I am a pit player. I play mallet instruments. For marching band, I played the bells.For Winter Drumline, I play the Vibraphone. All I said about Pit is true. I like being in pit because its fun, i like the instruments i play/played and I like my band mates. I love the song we played for marching band this year. Its called "Sahara" but we did not finish movement 3. This year for Winter Drumline, its a secret.;)</p>
