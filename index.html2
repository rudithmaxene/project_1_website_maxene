  <h1> Front Ensemble(Pit) #2 </h1>
  </body>
  The main emphasis of the pit in drum corps style groups are the mallet instruments: marimba, vibraphone, bells and xylophone. Some marching band circuits also allow non-standard instruments (such as the violin) or electronic/electric instruments (such as synthesizers and bass guitars) in the pit. However, this is extremely controversial and divisive within the marching band community, and was prohibited outright by Drum Corps International until 2008, when it was passed in an 11-4 vote.

Pit members will sometimes operate auxiliary equipment such as props, either inside or outside of the pit area.

In indoor drumline, the front ensemble may not necessarily be placed at the front as the name suggests. The show designers place the pit where it would be most effective for the show.

The term "pit" comes from musical theater, where the accompanying orchestra sits in the orchestra pit.
