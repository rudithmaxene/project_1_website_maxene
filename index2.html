  <h1> Front Ensemble(Pit) #2 </h1>
  </body>
<p> Groups began adding more modern, traditional percussion instruments to Pit.
  Some marching bands also allow non-standard instruments such as violin and electrical/electric instruments.
  Pit is usually led by mallet instruments. Being up front has its own set of opportunities and challenges just like any other Marching Band sections.
   For instance, Front Ensemble has to transport big heavy instruments but making music with mallet instruments is fun. </p>
