  <h1> Front Ensemble(Pit) #2 </h1>
  <h3> Winter Drumline and Marching Band</h3>
  </body>
<p> Groups began adding more modern, traditional percussion instruments to Pit.
  Some marching bands also allow non-standard instruments such as violin and electrical/electric instruments.
  Pit is usually led by mallet instruments. Being up front has its own set of opportunities and challenges just like any other Marching Band sections.
   For instance, Front Ensemble has to transport big heavy instruments but making music with mallet instruments is fun. </p>
   <p> Pit is usually the only section that does not march but they work as hard as any other section. Other sections sometimes call pit players "The Lazy Ones." It is because we dont march and they think we dont practice enough but we practice as much as any other sections. Us, pit players, we work really hard and our hands start hurting because of those heavy mallets. Our Back starts hurting because of us leaning to reach the flats and sharps, our hand starts hurting from hitting the bongos too much and our legs start hurting from pulsing. Pit players are a hard working group.</p>
