The Front Ensemble,Pit, is placed by the 50 yard line and in front of the stance.
 Front ensemble is also part of a thing called Winter Drumline. Winter Drumline is only for Battery and Pit. Like in Marching band, they go to compettions. Last year, Pasadena High School's Winter Drumline won first place in the Novice Division by performing "Rite of Spring" by Igor Stravinsky. </p>
<p> In Winter Drumline, mallet instruments does the chorus/verses of the songs.They usually do a lot of solos because they are the main instrument that plays notes with different sound on them. Each Mallet Instrument makes different sounds. For example, the MARIMBA is a low-pitched instrument. The XYLOPHONE is somewhat higher than the marimba and the vibraphone. The VIBRAPHONE produces a more higher-lower sound with a pedal.
