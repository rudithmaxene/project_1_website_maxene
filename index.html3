  </body>
<p> A typical life in pit requires more hard work and more practice. Pit people usually go up to the field first when they practice because it takes them a long time to push heavy equipments and it takes a long time to set up. Like any other section, Pit has more responsibilites for the care of their instruments. Pit instruments such as mallets instruments are delicate. Pit is a really fun section. </p>
