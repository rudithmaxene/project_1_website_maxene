  <h1> Front Ensemble(Pit) #3 </h1>
  </body>
  <p> BEING UP FRONT AND CENTER HAS ITS OWN SETS OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. WITH UNIQUE INSTRUMENTATION AND SOUNDS, THE FRONT ENSEMBLE ADDS A NEW LEVEL OF MUSICAL AND VISUAL INTEREST FOR AUDIENCES AND JUDGES. HOWEVER, PIT MEMBERS OFTEN NEED TO WORK EXTRA HARD ON AVOIDING PHASING ISSUES DURING PERFORMANCES, TRANSPORTING HEAVY EQUIPMENT, AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, GELLING WITH THE REST OF THE BAND.
